# Customer_Churn_Predictive_Model
This project is a machine learning solution designed to predict customer churn based on various customer attributes and behaviors. The model provides actionable insights to help businesses identify customers likely to leave and take preventive measures. It uses advanced preprocessing techniques, including encoding categorical variables, and produces both class predictions and confidence probabilities.

The Customer Churn Predictive Model is a machine learning-driven solution designed to help businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their products or services. By analyzing customer attributes and behaviors, the model uncovers patterns that signal potential churn, enabling organizations to take timely and effective actions to retain at-risk customers.

This model leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques to handle diverse datasets, including encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing missing data. It provides not only binary class predictions (churn or no churn) but also confidence probabilities, offering deeper insights into customer behavior. With this predictive capability, businesses can enhance customer retention strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
