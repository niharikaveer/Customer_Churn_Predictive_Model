# Customer Churn Predictive Model

## Project Overview
The **Customer Churn Predictive Model** is a machine learning-driven solution designed to help businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their products or services. By analyzing customer attributes and behaviors, the model uncovers patterns that signal potential churn, enabling organizations to take timely and effective actions to retain at-risk customers.

Customer churn is a critical metric for any business, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This model leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques, classification algorithms, and predictive analytics to accurately identify customers likely to churn. The model offers binary class predictions (churn or no churn) and provides confidence probabilities, offering deeper insights into customer behavior. With this predictive capability, businesses can enhance customer retention strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer information and transaction data. It includes various customer attributes such as demographics, subscription details, and usage patterns. The dataset includes a target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (left) or is still actively using the service.

### Dataset Features:
Here are the attributes available in the dataset:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
- **SeniorCitizen**: Indicates whether the customer is a senior citizen (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **Partner**: Whether the customer has a partner (e.g., Yes, No).
- **Dependents**: Whether the customer has dependents (e.g., Yes, No).
- **Tenure**: The number of months the customer has been with the company.
- **PhoneService**: Whether the customer subscribes to phone service (e.g., Yes, No).
- **MultipleLines**: Whether the customer has multiple lines (e.g., Yes, No, No phone service).
- **InternetService**: Type of internet service the customer subscribes to (e.g., DSL, Fiber optic, No internet service).
- **OnlineSecurity**: Whether the customer has online security (e.g., Yes, No, No internet service).
- **OnlineBackup**: Whether the customer has online backup (e.g., Yes, No, No internet service).
- **DeviceProtection**: Whether the customer has device protection (e.g., Yes, No, No internet service).
- **TechSupport**: Whether the customer has tech support (e.g., Yes, No, No internet service).
- **StreamingTV**: Whether the customer has streaming TV (e.g., Yes, No, No internet service).
- **StreamingMovies**: Whether the customer has streaming movies (e.g., Yes, No, No internet service).
- **Contract**: Type of contract the customer has (e.g., Month-to-month, One year, Two year).
- **PaperlessBilling**: Whether the customer subscribes to paperless billing (e.g., Yes, No).
- **PaymentMethod**: Method of payment the customer uses (e.g., Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card).
- **MonthlyCharges**: The amount the customer pays per month.
- **TotalCharges**: The total amount the customer has paid.
- **Churn**: The target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (1: Churned, 0: Not Churned).

The dataset is typically available from publicly accessible sources or can be created based on company-specific customer data.
