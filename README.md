# Customer_Churn_Predictive_Model

The Customer Churn Predictive Model is a machine learning-driven solution designed to help businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their products or services. By analyzing customer attributes and behaviors, the model uncovers patterns that signal potential churn, enabling organizations to take timely and effective actions to retain at-risk customers.

This model leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques to handle diverse datasets, including encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing missing data. It provides not only binary class predictions (churn or no churn) but also confidence probabilities, offering deeper insights into customer behavior. With this predictive capability, businesses can enhance customer retention strategies, optimize marketing efforts, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
